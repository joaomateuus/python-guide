# Tuples
### In Python tuples are very similar to lists, however, unlike lists they are immutable meaning they can not be changed. You would use tuples to present things that shouldn't be changed, such as days of the week, or dates on a calendar.
### Now we'll learn about the following topics:
* 1- Constructing Tuples
* 2 - Basic Tuple Methods
* 3 - Immutability
* 4 - When to Use Tuples
